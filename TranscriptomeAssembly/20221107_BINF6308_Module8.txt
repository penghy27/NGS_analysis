** de novo whole genome assembly
- why cost expensive?
- no reference sequence
- short reads(?) for ???
- more data assembly??


** Transcriptome assembly
why harder?
- gap: intron is removed
- different splicing...or junctiton....
- different reads to support different conformation?


** Genome assembly -> transcriptome assembly
gap -> unknown sequence?


** Trinity for transcriptome assembly
after assembling short reads...,
contigs cluster is the important step, the contigs are similar but not identical
represnt different forms(isomer) to that gene. differs from DNA.
bcoz transcript share from one gene...??
-> isomer -->> draw the graph: de Bruijin graphs...
-> reconstructed isoforms...


** Trinity also uses kmers for faster contig assembly


** Merging bam files
bam: initial files(?)
-b: binary file
sam: human readabe file(?!)


** Assessing Trinity output
total trinity "genes" --> 26k within that cluster (isomer from the same "gene"??????)


** IGV (Integrated Genomics Viewer)
