# Genome and Transcriptome Analysis

This Northeastern academic project contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive genome and transcriptome analysis. Below are the key tasks and tools used in this analysis, along with links to the corresponding GitHub repositories for reference.
  
## Genome Assembly and Quality Evaluation

Performed genome assembly and quality evaluation using Trimmomatic, Spades, and Quast.
