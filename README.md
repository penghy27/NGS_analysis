# Genome and Transcriptome Analysis

This Northeastern academic project contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive genome and transcriptome analysis. Below are the key tasks and tools used in this analysis, along with links to the corresponding GitHub repositories for reference.
  
## Genome Assembly and Quality Evaluation

Performed genome assembly and quality evaluation using Trimmomatic, Spades, and Quast.

## Protein Sequence Prediction and Annotation

Predicted protein sequences and candidate coding regions with BLAST and TransDecoder.
Aligned protein sequences with SwissProt on Northeasternâ€™s High-Performance Computing platform.
